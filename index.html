              <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Hi! my name is Matt Palucki.  I'm from Park Ridge, IL, a northwest suburb of Chicago.  I'm currently a senior at Washington University in St. Louis.  Upon graduation, I plan to have a dual-degree in Systems Engineering and Finance.  Outside of the classroom, I have been a member of the varsity men's basketball team for the past 4 years.</p>

              <h4>Goals</h4>
              <p>My current goal is to find employment in a firm or professional basketball team upon graduation in May 2015.  As you will see throughout the site, I believe my academics, basketball experience, and work experience set me apart from other candidates.  I have successfully balanced all three of these areas at Wash U through hard work, perseverance, and dedication.  I pride myself in taking part in a diversified set of activities because being one dimensional only offers so much to potential employers.  After viewing my profile, please visit the Contact section if you would like to get in touch or have any questions.  Thanks!!</p>
              
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <h4>Basketball</h4>
              <p>  Wash U men's basketball has captured 3 UAA titles and appeared in 4 NCAA tournaments in the time I have been on the team.  To see more of my individual accolades from Wash U basketball, check out my Basketball section! More important than these accolades are the intangible skills that I have gained from being on the team.  For example, my leadership and work ethic have grown exponentially over the past 4 years.  These intangible skills along with my proven success set me apart from other candidates.  After 4 years of college basketball, I still have the hunger to continue my playing career.  If you are interested in me being a member of your team, please follow the link to the recruiter form in the Basektball section.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
              <h4>Academics</h4>
              <p>I have undertaken a rigorous work load at Wash U.  The dual-degree program entails completing 30 extra units of study compared to a traditional single or double major program.  This is equivalently two extra semesters of work that I plan to complete in only 4 years.  Therefore, in essence, I'm completing 5 years of study in only 4!  I have developed expert problem solving and data analytic skills through my concentration in engineering and finance.  In addition, I have been significantly exposed to different programming languages through my course work.  This experience positions my strengths in fields such as consulting or investment banking; however, I believe I have the ability to adapt and learn any responsibilities a postion may have to offer.</p>
